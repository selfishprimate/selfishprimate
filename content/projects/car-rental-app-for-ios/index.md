Otorento offers users one of the cheapest and safest ways to rent a car in Turkey. Users can rent a car safely using desktop and mobile websites.

The challenge was to analyze the current product, define the well-functioning parts, and find solutions for the problematic ones. In the end, to make a synthesis of all these findings and design a user-centered iOS application for users.

I’ve tried to reduce the users’ task load with a search functionality supported by features like geolocation, latest searches, popular locations, etc.

Calendar screen where users select the pickup and return dates.

Rather than using a complex filtering screen, I've designed a smart filtering feature with horizontal scrolling located at the top of the search results.

The system should support users to use some of the basic functionalities without registering to the system. Here, the user can check his/her reservations without logging in to the system.

The system should support users to register to the system easily.

Thank you for watching.
