I’ve tried to use some modern colors and UI components to make an old-fashioned user interface more usable, and spacious for the users.

{{< figure

    caption="A modern design approach for an online banking web application." >}}

Considering the large scope of the project and the endless small demands that come from the customer, it is obvious that this design is living in a fantasy world. But again, I had to see it.

Thank you for reading.
