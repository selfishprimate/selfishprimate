My goal was to make a design evaluation in order to find the fundamental usability flaws and redesign the filtering section based on these findings. By doing it, I was aiming to ensure that the filtering system will be easy to use, efficient, predictable and appealing for the users.

I began by creating a clear and prominent 'Sort and Filter' button while also tidying up the inconsistent spaces surrounding it for a more cohesive design.

I chose to divide each filtering section, enabling users to concentrate on particular criteria without feeling inundated. The uncluttered design and easy interactions empower users to effortlessly narrow down their searches, guaranteeing a pleasant and efficient browsing journey.

Embracing Google Material Design principles, I utilized familiar components such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and sliders. By incorporating these widely recognized elements, I aimed to create an interface that felt instantly intuitive to users.
