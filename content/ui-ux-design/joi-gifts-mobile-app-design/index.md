### Overview

Embarked on a transformative journey with Joi Gifts to enhance user experience and performance by transitioning from old webview technology to a native mobile app. The goal was to address existing UX issues and leverage native app features to deliver a seamless and intuitive experience for users. This project entailed defining requirements, establishing robust design tokenomics, and creating a comprehensive design system to guide development.

### Objectives

* Fix performance and UX issues by migrating to a native mobile app platform.
* Enhance usability and offer a smooth user experience through native app features and components such as notifications, bottom sheets, and dialog boxes.
* Define needs and create a solid design tokenomics and design system to ensure consistency and efficiency in development.
* Generate design tokens in JSON format and share them with the development team via GitHub.
* Design essential components required to create screens, ensuring alignment with design system principles and user needs.

### Research

Initiated the project by conducting comprehensive research to uncover critical usability issues impacting both business performance and user satisfaction. Leveraged heuristic evaluation to assess the existing system against recognized usability principles, identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, delved into analytics data to gain insights into user behavior and interaction patterns. Engaged with the customer care department to gather real user feedback, understanding their pain points and frustrations firsthand. This multifaceted approach provided valuable insights that informed subsequent design decisions and optimizations.

### Ideation and Prototyping
Proceeded with the ideation phase, conducting thorough competitor analysis to identify areas of opportunity and best practices in the industry. Utilized low-fidelity screens to initiate discussions with the design team and stakeholders, fostering collaboration and alignment on design objectives. Throughout the process, iteratively refined concepts and solutions based on feedback and insights gathered from stakeholders.

Implemented interactive prototypes for complex user flows, such as selecting delivery date and time or creating automatic gift messages using AI. These prototypes served as invaluable tools for testing and validating design concepts, allowing for early identification of usability issues and opportunities for improvement.

 ### Challenges

A key challenge was conveying the importance of a design system to the team. To overcome this, I actively communicated the benefits, such as streamlined processes, consistency, and collaboration. By providing real-world examples and encouraging feedback, we established buy-in and alignment, paving the way for smoother design and development processes.

### Design Process

Throughout the design process, I relied on Figma as my primary design tool for creating high-fidelity designs and prototypes. Additionally, I utilized the Token Studio for Figma plugin to manage and maintain design tokens, ensuring consistency across screens and scalability in design systems.

I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the design.

### Shopping Cart

In crafting the "Cart" page, I aimed for a sleek user interface that facilitates seamless interaction. Key features include the ability for users to adjust item quantities and manage products easily. Delivery information is prominently displayed beneath the product list for quick reference. Additionally, a quick summary bottom sheet appears upon checkout, allowing users to review their preferences and make any necessary changes before proceeding. This design ensures a smooth shopping experience, prioritizing clarity and user control.

### Gift Reminder

With the gift reminder feature, users can effortlessly create reminders for birthdays, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and more. 

Reminders can be set for one-time events or annually, providing flexibility for recurring occasions. Once created, reminders are conveniently stored under the 'Reminders' section on the 'Account' page, easily accessible for future reference. Upcoming reminders are highlighted at the top of the list, indicated with a green color for quick identification. Users can edit or remove reminders with ease using the intuitive interface.

### Address Management

To enhance the user experience and streamline address management, I designed a seamless flow accessible from the "Account" page. Users can easily view, edit, or remove their saved addresses with a clear and intuitive interface.

When users tap the "Add New Address" button, they are taken to a screen where they can input a new recipient address. This screen offers two options: manually entering the address details or using the map view for a more interactive experience. This dual approach caters to both novice users who prefer straightforward input and advanced users who benefit from a more visual method.
