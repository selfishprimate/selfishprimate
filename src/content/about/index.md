# Beyond Design
When I'm not designing beautiful interfaces, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes, sketching and drawing, or cruising around on my skateboard. I've always had a passion for creating and tinkering with things, which is what drew me to the world of UI/UX design.

I'm also a big advocate for open-source software and tools. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial means. That's why I'm working on a number of open-source projects that aim to make design and development more accessible to people all over the world.
