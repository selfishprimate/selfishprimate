## Overview

The objective was to conduct a design evaluation identifying usability problems, then redesign the filtering system for ease of use, efficiency, predictability, and user appeal.

## Design Approach

The design prioritized simplicity and clarity for diverse user needs, creating a prominent Sort and Filter button while improving surrounding spacing consistency.

## Organized Filter Sections

Individual filtering sections were separated to help users focus on specific criteria without overwhelm. The uncluttered approach enables efficient search narrowing.
