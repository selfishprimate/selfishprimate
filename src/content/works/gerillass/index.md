### Overview

I created Gerillass during the Covid pandemic as an open-source contribution to the developer community. The library serves as a Sass toolkit for frontend developers, offering utilities to build responsive websites efficiently.

The project represents shared effort during challenging times, emphasizing community collaboration and open-source values.

### Philosophy

The library is built around the idea that CSS should be:
- **Predictable:** Consistent naming and behavior
- **Maintainable:** Easy to update and extend
- **Performant:** Minimal output, maximum efficiency

### Key Features

- **Responsive Mixins:** Easy breakpoint management
- **Animation Utilities:** Pre-built animation patterns
- **Layout Helpers:** Flexbox and Grid shortcuts
- **Typography Scale:** Modular type scaling

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation with examples for every mixin and function is available to help developers adopt Gerillass and enhance their workflow efficiency and skills.
