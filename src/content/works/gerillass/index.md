### The Story Behind Gerillass

Since my early days writing HTML and CSS, I had been building a personal Sass library. A collection of mixins and utilities that I used across projects, solving real problems I encountered in frontend development. I always wanted to make it public, to help other developers streamline their workflows and save them the time I spent figuring things out.

When the pandemic hit and we found ourselves locked indoors, I finally had the time to focus on this project alone. I restructured the codebase, wrote comprehensive documentation, and prepared everything for public release. What started as a personal toolkit evolved into Gerillass, a library now used by thousands of developers worldwide.

### Philosophy

Gerillass is built on top of Sass to give developers flexibility and accelerate both performance and creativity. The utilities were developed based on real frontend challenges I faced over the years, drawing inspiration from established frameworks like Bourbon, Susy, Scut, and Bootstrap.

The core principles:
- **Practical:** Every mixin solves a real problem
- **Flexible:** Adapts to your workflow, not the other way around
- **Performant:** Minimal output, maximum efficiency

### Features

The library includes 50+ utilities covering essential frontend needs:

**Layout & Positioning**
Mixins like Center, Position, Sizer, and Ratio Box handle common layout challenges. The Escape to Parent utility lets child elements break out of their container constraints.

**Responsive Design**
Breakpoint management made simple with Adaptive, Breakpoint, and device-specific mixins for Smartphone and Tablet. Responsive Image and Responsive Video utilities handle media scaling.

**Visual Effects**
Create shapes with Triangle and Circle mixins. Apply gradients with Linear Gradient, Radial Gradient, and the unique Text Gradient. Add depth with Text Shadow and Text Stroke.

**Background Utilities**
Generate patterns with Background Dots and Background Stripes. Manage images efficiently with Background Image mixin.

**Typography**
Handle text overflow with Ellipsis, customize input placeholders, and control text selection styles.

**Structural Tools**
Clearfix, Border Box, Reset CSS, and Columnizer provide foundational structure for any project.
