### Overview

Otorento provides affordable and secure car rental services in Turkey through desktop and mobile platforms. My task involved analyzing the existing product, identifying functional elements, addressing problem areas, and creating a user-focused mobile application.

### Simplified Search Interface

The original app featured cluttered interfaces with limited user support. The redesigned search interface incorporates geolocation services, search history, and popular location suggestions to reduce cognitive load. By eliminating unnecessary design elements, users can focus on what matters most: finding and booking a car.

### Calendar Selection

The calendar selection for pickup and return dates includes top navigation feedback to encourage task completion. Users can clearly see their selected dates and easily modify their choices.

### Smart Filtering & Search Results

A horizontal-scrolling smart filter system was implemented as a simplified alternative to complex filtering. This approach addresses limited development resources while covering essential options like fuel type, vehicle body, and transmission.

### Account Management

The system enables basic functionality access without registration, allowing users to check reservations without logging in. This reduces friction for first-time users while still providing full features for registered members.

### Streamlined Registration

Registration was streamlined using one-time passwords sent via SMS for quick account creation. This approach minimizes the steps required to create an account while maintaining security.
