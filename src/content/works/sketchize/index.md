**The easiest way to turn your ideas into lovely sketches!**

### Overview

Sketchize is a free tool designed for UI/UX designers and anyone interested in design. It offers A4-sized, printable device templates for desktops, smartphones, and tablets, including sketchpad models. Templates are available in horizontal and vertical orientations with dotted and plain versions.

### Why Sketchize?

As designers, we often start with pen and paper before moving to digital tools. Sketchize supports user-centered design, promotes rapid prototyping, and aims to contribute to the design community with free, accessible resources. I noticed that while there were many digital wireframing tools, there weren't many good resources for physical sketching with proper device frames and grids.

### What's Inside?

The tool offers comprehensive template variety with orientation and style options, plus smartphone multi-layout configurations.

### iPhone Templates

Single, 2up, and 3up layouts available in plain and dotted grid versions. Landscape versions included for game designers.
