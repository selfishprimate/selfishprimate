> "Design systems provide a shared language and set of guidelines that enable teams to work more efficiently and create cohesive user experiences." — Nathan Curtis

### Overview

This project establishes a unified design system for Joi Gifts ensuring consistency across desktop, mobile web, and native applications. The goal is to streamline processes for a cohesive user experience.

### Objectives

- Establish comprehensive design system for Joi Gifts
- Ensure design and usability consistency across platforms
- Bridge design-development team gaps
- Create efficient workflow reducing future costs

### Introduction

The initiative was explained to teams emphasizing cost-effectiveness and consistency benefits. The goal was to eliminate design-development gaps and create a single source of truth.

### Research & Incremental Approach

We started with essentials, created a component checklist, and excluded non-essential items to focus on what matters most for the product.

### Token Creation

We used Figma and Token Studio plugin to create design tokens including colors, typography, spacing, sizing, and shadows. These were converted to JSON for GitHub sharing, enabling rapid codebase updates.

#### Colors

The color system establishes a cohesive palette that reflects the brand identity while ensuring accessibility and visual hierarchy.

#### Sizing & Spacing

Consistent sizing and spacing tokens create rhythm and harmony across the interface, making the product feel polished and intentional.

#### Shadow & Border Radius

These tokens add depth and softness to the interface, creating a modern and approachable visual language.

#### Typography

The typography system defines type scales, weights, and styles that ensure readability, hierarchy, and professionalism across all content.

### Collaboration & Development

Regular developer meetings ensured successful implementation. Tokens and components were updated as needed based on feedback.

### Challenges

The primary obstacle involved convincing the team and stakeholders despite initial costs. However, the long-term benefits proved invaluable.

### Component Library

A comprehensive system of reusable UI components with documented variants and states.

#### Form Controls

Essential form elements including checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches with consistent styling and interaction patterns.

#### Feedback Components

Components for user feedback including alerts, bottom sheets, and popups that maintain consistency in how we communicate with users.

### Iconography

Meticulous selection prioritizing stroke thickness for clarity, readability, and accessibility standards. Icons balance accessibility and aesthetics, enhancing recognition and visual harmony.

### Country Flags

Country flags are integral to country selection flows. They were designed in square, rounded, and circular versions, and shared with the Figma community as "Awesome Country Flags" asset.
