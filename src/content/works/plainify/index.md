**One markdown file to rule them all.**

## Overview

As AI coding assistants become increasingly integral to the development workflow, communicating requirements effectively has become a new challenge. Vague or unstructured briefs often lead to suboptimal AI outputs, wasting time and effort.

I created Plainify to bridge this gap. It's a web-based tool that enables developers to generate structured product specifications in PLAIN format (Product Language for AI Notation). With a 14-section framework, real-time markdown preview, and AI-ready export capabilities, Plainify transforms how we communicate with AI assistants.

## Key Features

- **14-Section Framework** — A comprehensive structure covering all aspects of product specifications
- **Real-Time Preview** — See your markdown output as you build your specification
- **AI-Ready Export** — Direct compatibility with major AI assistants like Claude and GPT
- **Free & Open Source** — Available on GitHub for the community to use and contribute

## The Problem It Solves

Traditional product requirements documents weren't designed for AI consumption. Plainify provides a standardized, machine-readable format that leads to better AI-assisted coding outcomes. Instead of spending time clarifying requirements back and forth, developers can create clear specifications from the start.
