This project was born from a weekly UI challenge at Mobven while partnering with Edenred, Turkey's leading meal card provider. Rather than treating it as a simple visual exercise, our design team approached it as a full-fledged product exploration, conducting user interviews, analyzing pain points, and designing solutions that addressed real-world problems faced by millions of meal card users.

### The Challenge

Edenred's existing mobile application served its basic purpose but fell short of modern user expectations. Through user interviews and our own experiences as meal card users, we identified several friction points:

- **Payment friction:** Users still relied heavily on physical cards, missing opportunities for faster, contactless transactions
- **Tedious onboarding:** Adding a new card required manual entry of 16-digit numbers, a process prone to errors
- **Limited visibility:** Users lacked insights into their spending patterns and couldn't easily track where their money went
- **Discovery problems:** Finding partner restaurants that accepted Edenred cards was cumbersome and unintuitive

### Solution & Approach

We reimagined the Edenred experience from the ground up, focusing on three core principles: speed, simplicity, and delight. Each feature was designed to reduce friction and make everyday transactions effortless.

### Contactless Payments with OTP

The flagship feature: one-time password generation for cardless payments. Users can generate a 6-digit code directly from the app, share it with the cashier, and complete the transaction, no physical card needed. The code expires after 120 seconds, ensuring security without sacrificing convenience.

### QR Code Payments

For an even faster experience, we designed a QR-based payment flow. Users simply scan the merchant's QR code, verify the amount on the confirmation screen, and approve the transaction. The entire process takes less than 10 seconds.

### Smart Card Registration

We eliminated the frustration of manual card entry by offering three registration methods: traditional number input, camera-based scanning, and NFC tap. Each option displays estimated completion time, letting users choose based on their preference. The NFC option takes just 5 seconds.

### Wallet Management & Spending Insights

The redesigned wallet view puts essential information front and center: current balance, quick actions for deposits and transfers, and easy access to transaction history. The spending breakdown feature visualizes monthly expenses by restaurant, helping users understand their dining habits at a glance.

### AR Restaurant Discovery

The most experimental feature: an augmented reality view that transforms restaurant discovery into an interactive experience. Point your camera at your surroundings, and partner restaurants appear as floating markers. Tap any marker to see details, ratings, and available discounts, perfect for exploring new lunch spots in unfamiliar areas.

### Wearable Extension

To complete the ecosystem, we designed an Apple Watch companion app. Users can check their balance at a glance and make NFC payments directly from their wrist, ideal for quick coffee runs or when your phone isn't readily accessible.

### Reflection

This project demonstrated the value of treating design challenges as real product opportunities. By grounding our explorations in actual user research and personal pain points, we created concepts that went beyond visual polish to address genuine needs. While these designs remained conceptual, they influenced discussions about the future direction of Edenred's digital experience in Turkey.
