### Overview

This project originated as a weekly UI challenge at Mobven while partnering with Edenred. The design team addressed real-world payment issues by designing improved features and screens based on user interviews and personal experiences.

### Payments with OTP

Users generate one-time passwords through the application for quick and contactless payments. This streamlines the payment process, enabling secure transactions without physical cards.

### Payments with QR Code

Scan restaurant-displayed QR codes, view the confirmation screen, and complete transactions. This enables fast, stress-free payments.

### Adding a Card to the System

Manual card entry is a lengthy process. Card addition was simplified through NFC and scanning technologies to reduce the task load and make card management easier.

### Sending/Receiving Money

Transfer funds between bank accounts, e-wallets, and other Edenred users. This maintains campaign access and increases engagement while keeping promotional benefits accessible.

### Augmented Reality

An augmented reality feature displays nearby partner restaurants as flashing markers on screen, allowing users to tap for detailed restaurant information. This simplifies decision-making when choosing where to eat.
