## Overview

This project presents a modern paywall design for Interesting Engineering, built on Google Material Design System principles with two alternative screen approaches.

## Design Alternative 1: Integrated Web Format

The first design integrates Material Design into standard web formatting with a sleek header, intuitive navigational bar leading to subcategories, and strategically placed elements like search, subscribe, and sign-in buttons. This approach prioritizes simplicity and transaction ease.

## Design Alternative 2: Minimalist Popup

The second design embraces minimalism by stripping away extraneous elements and presenting a focused popup experience. This strategy eliminates distractions to concentrate users on entering payment information.

## Design Principles

Both solutions follow Material Design principles while prioritizing:
- Navigation clarity
- Content focus
- Simplified transaction flow
- Visual hierarchy

I hope these designs inspire innovation in digital interface solutions.
